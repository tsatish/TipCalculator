TipCalculator
=============

A basic website that will calculate your tip based on level of service.

Currently, the calculator only takes into account the level of service.

Excellent service is tipped at 20%;
Good service is tipped at 15%;
Bad service is tipped at 7%.

In the future, I will improve the CSS by playing with Twitter Bootstrap. Also, I will add the option to split the bill and tip.
